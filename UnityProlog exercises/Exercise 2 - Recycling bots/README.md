# Task
Implement the knowledge base of the *LearningBot*, *PlasticBot* and *PaperBot* agents, such as:

1. The LearningBot doesn’t know how to recycle anything but is able to analyse objects and ask other robots when in doubt, it can learn plans and delegate actions
1. The PlasticBot can recycle objects marked as plastic but nothing more, if it encounters an object different from plastic, it will ignore it
1. The PaperBot can recycle objects marked as paper but nothing more, differently from the other robots, it does nothing unless someone else asks for its help.
